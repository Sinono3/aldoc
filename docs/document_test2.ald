# An introduction to Aldoc.

*aldoc* is a markup language created by Aldo Acevedo, which takes heavy
inspiration from Markdown. Its goal is to provide the simple syntax
that Markdown (Pandoc's version, especifically) has, but without the 
quirks that it brings with it, such as:

- Different versions and editions of Markdown which vary mildly in 
syntax, thus making it unreliable for posting on multiple platforms 
(GitHub Markdown, original HTML Markdown, Pandoc Markdown, etc.)
- Markdown was not intended for use outside of small documents, such as
small notes or READMEs, which led to decisions that impacted the
ergonomics in the syntax (pandoc filters) and ended up in the creation of the different
versions.

The aldoc compiler actually only plays a small part in the compilation:

- (1st) The aldoc source is parsed and compiled to LaTeX.
- (2nd) The LaTeX code is compiled to PDF.
